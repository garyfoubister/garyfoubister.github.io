Welcome to my project portfolio!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I am a passionate about creating innovative and engaging digital experiences 
across multiple platforms and devices. I have delivered world-class projects 
for clients such as Microsoft, Warner Brothers, Frito-Lay, Intel, Char-Broil, 
U.S. Soccer and many more. 

In this portfolio, you will find some of the projects (but not all) that I 
have worked on, either individually or with my team(s), using various 
technologies and tools. Whether it is a website, an app, a game, or a software 
product, I always strive to deliver high-quality results that meet the needs 
and expectations of my clients and users. 

I hope you enjoy browsing through my project highlights and feel free to 
contact me if you have any questions or feedback.
